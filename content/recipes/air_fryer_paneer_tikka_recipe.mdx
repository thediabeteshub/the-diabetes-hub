There's something magical about the sizzle of paneer tikka arriving at your table — that intoxicating aroma of charred spices, the vibrant colors of bell peppers and onions, and that first bite of perfectly smoky, tender paneer that melts in your mouth.

I used to think achieving that restaurant-style char and depth of flavor was impossible without a tandoor oven. Then I discovered the air fryer could work the same magic, giving me crispy edges, smoky flavors, and that coveted char — all while using 80% less oil than traditional methods.

This recipe has become my go-to for everything from weeknight snacks to dinner party appetizers. The best part? It's ready in just 25 minutes, making it perfect for those "I need something impressive but quick" moments we all have.

## 👨‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Create the Marinade Magic (5 minutes)**
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, and all the spices. The marinade should be thick enough to coat the paneer without dripping off. If your yogurt is too watery, hang it in a cheesecloth for 10 minutes first — trust me, this makes all the difference for achieving that restaurant-style coating!

### **Step 2: Prep the Paneer & Vegetables (3 minutes)**
Pat the paneer cubes completely dry with paper towels — this is crucial for getting that beautiful char. Cut your bell peppers and onions into similar-sized pieces (about 1-inch) so everything cooks evenly.

### **Step 3: Marinate Everything (5-10 minutes)**
Gently fold the paneer, bell peppers, and onions into the marinade. Be gentle with the paneer to avoid breaking it. Let it marinate for at least 5 minutes (or up to 2 hours in the fridge for deeper flavor). Even this short marination time works wonders!

### **Step 4: Preheat Your Air Fryer (2 minutes)**
Preheat your air fryer to 200°C (390°F). This high heat is what gives us that coveted char and keeps the paneer tender inside.

### **Step 5: Arrange for Success (2 minutes)**
Lightly spray or brush your air fryer basket with oil. Arrange the marinated paneer and vegetables in a single layer, ensuring pieces don't touch too much. Work in batches if needed — overcrowding leads to steaming instead of charring.

### **Step 6: Air Fry to Perfection (10-12 minutes)**
- **First 6 minutes:** Cook at 200°C (390°F) without opening
- **Flip time:** Gently turn pieces using tongs
- **Final 4-6 minutes:** Continue cooking until edges are charred and paneer has beautiful golden spots

**Pro Tip:** If you want extra char, brush with a tiny bit more oil before the final 2 minutes!

### **Step 7: The Final Touch (1 minute)**
Remove from air fryer and immediately sprinkle with fresh mint, cilantro, and a squeeze of lemon juice while it's still sizzling hot.

### **🌶️ Spice Level Adjustments:**

- **Spicy:** Add ½ tsp cayenne pepper + 1 chopped green chili

### **🥗 Make It Your Own:**
- **Vegan Version:** Substitute firm tofu or vegan paneer + coconut yogurt
- **Low-Fat:** Use fat-free Greek yogurt + cooking spray instead of oil

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I make this without an air fryer?**
A: Absolutely! Bake at 220°C (425°F) for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through. You can also grill on medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes.

**Q: My paneer keeps breaking. What am I doing wrong?**
A: Use firm paneer and handle it gently. Patting dry before marinating also helps maintain structure.

**Q: Can I skip the yogurt in the marinade?**
A: Yogurt provides tenderness and helps spices adhere, but you can substitute with thick coconut cream or cashew cream for vegan options.

**Q: How do I know when it's perfectly cooked?**
A: Look for golden-brown edges with slight char spots. The paneer should feel firm but yield to gentle pressure.

**Q: Can I use paneer straight from the package?**
A: Fresh is best, but packaged paneer works fine. Just make sure to drain any excess liquid and pat completely dry.
