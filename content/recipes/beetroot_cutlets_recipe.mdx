## 🥬 The Health Benefits That'll Make You Feel Great

Beetroot isn't just pretty to look at — it's a nutritional powerhouse! These ruby gems are loaded with nitrates that support heart health and may help lower blood pressure. Plus, they're packed with folate, fiber, and betalains (those gorgeous red pigments that act as antioxidants).

Combined with the protein-rich chickpea flour and fiber from potatoes, these cutlets are surprisingly filling and blood-sugar friendly. My diabetic aunt swears by these as her go-to evening snack!

## 👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Prep Your Beetroot (The Fun Part!)**
Wash and peel the beetroots. Grate them using the coarse side of a box grater or food processor. **Pro tip:** Wear gloves to avoid staining your hands! The vibrant color is gorgeous but stubborn.

### **Step 2: Steam-Cook the Beetroot**
Place grated beetroot in a microwave-safe bowl with 2 tbsp water. Cover and microwave for 3-4 minutes until tender. Alternatively, steam on stovetop for 5-6 minutes. Drain any excess water and let cool.

### **Step 3: Prepare the Binding Base**
In a large mixing bowl, mash the boiled potatoes until smooth. Add the cooled beetroot, chickpea flour, chopped onion, ginger-garlic paste, and green chili.

### **Step 4: Season to Perfection**
Add cumin seeds, ground coriander, turmeric, red chili powder (if using), and salt. Mix in the fresh cilantro and mint. **Taste test here** — this is your chance to adjust seasoning!

### **Step 5: Form the Cutlets**
With slightly damp hands, take portions of the mixture (about 2-3 tbsp each) and shape into oval or round patties, about ½ inch thick. You should get 12-15 cutlets.

### **Step 6: Optional Coating Magic**
For extra crispiness, lightly roll each cutlet in breadcrumbs. This step is optional but gives that satisfying crunch factor!

### **Step 7: Air-Fry to Golden Perfection**
Preheat your air fryer to 375°F (190°C). Lightly spray or brush cutlets with oil. Cook in batches for 6 minutes, flip carefully, then air-fry another 4-6 minutes until golden brown and crispy.

### **Step 8: Serve & Enjoy!**
Let cool for 2-3 minutes before serving. The cutlets will be beautifully crispy outside and tender inside!

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I make these without an air fryer?**
A: Absolutely! Pan-fry in a non-stick skillet with 1-2 tsp oil over medium heat for 3-4 minutes per side, or bake at 400°F for 15-18 minutes, flipping halfway.

**Q: My beetroot is staining everything pink!**
A: This is totally normal and actually shows you're getting all those healthy betalains! Use gloves while handling and don't worry — the color mellows beautifully when cooked.

**Q: Can I use canned beetroot?**
A: Fresh is best for texture and flavor, but well-drained canned beetroot works in a pinch. Reduce cooking liquid since canned beets are softer.

**Q: Are these suitable for diabetics?**
A: Yes! The combination of beetroot's natural sweetness with protein-rich chickpea flour and fiber helps maintain steady blood sugar. As always, enjoy in moderation as part of a balanced meal.

**Q: Can I make these ahead for a party?**
A: Perfect party food! Shape cutlets up to a day ahead and refrigerate. Air-fry just before serving for maximum crispiness.

**Q: What if I don't have chickpea flour?**
A: Substitute with 2 tbsp all-purpose flour or cornstarch, though chickpea flour adds extra protein and authentic Indian flavor.
