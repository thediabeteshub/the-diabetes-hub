## 👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Par-Cook the Brown Rice (15 mins)
1. **Soak rice:** Rinse brown basmati rice until water runs clear, then soak for 20 minutes while you prep vegetables.

2. **Boil with aromatics:** In a large pot, bring 6 cups water to boil. Add whole spices (bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon) and 1½ tsp salt.

3. **Cook rice 70%:** Add drained rice and cook for 12-15 minutes until rice is 70% cooked (should have a slight bite). Drain immediately and set aside.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Brown rice takes longer than white rice, so don't rush this step. Under-cooked rice will be chewy in the final dish!

### Step 2: Prepare the Vegetable Base (20 mins)
1. **Fry onions:** Heat 2 tbsp ghee/oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Fry sliced onions until golden brown and crispy (about 8-10 minutes). Remove half for garnish.

2. **Cook vegetables:** To the remaining onions, add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for 1 minute. Add carrots, potatoes, and ground spices. Cook for 5 minutes.

3. **Add liquid:** Stir in yogurt, peas, chickpeas (if using), and ¼ cup warm water. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until vegetables are tender (8-10 minutes).

### Step 3: Layer and Dum Cook (25 mins)
1. **Layer assembly:** In the same pot, spread half the rice over the vegetable mixture. Sprinkle with half the mint and cilantro. Add remaining rice as the top layer.

2. **Final touches:** Dot with remaining ghee/oil, sprinkle reserved fried onions, remaining herbs, and a pinch of garam masala.

3. **Seal and steam:** Cover with aluminum foil, then place the lid tightly. Cook on high heat for 2 minutes, then reduce to lowest heat and cook for 35 minutes.

4. **Rest:** Turn off heat and let it rest for 10 minutes without opening the lid.
