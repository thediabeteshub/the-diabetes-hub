## 👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Prep Your Cauliflower Rice (5 minutes)**
If using fresh cauliflower, pulse florets in a food processor until they resemble rice grains. Don't over-process — you want rice-sized pieces, not mush! Pat dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.

*Pro Tip: Frozen cauliflower rice works great too — just thaw and pat completely dry before cooking.*

### **Step 2: Season & Sear the Chicken (8 minutes)**
Heat 1 tbsp ghee in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season chicken pieces with salt and turmeric. Sear chicken until golden brown on all sides (about 5-6 minutes). Remove and set aside — it doesn't need to be fully cooked yet.

### **Step 3: Create the Aromatic Base (5 minutes)**
In the same pot, add remaining 2 tbsp ghee. Add all whole spices (bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, cumin seeds) and let them sizzle for 30 seconds until fragrant — your kitchen should smell incredible right now!

Add sliced onions and cook until golden brown and caramelized (about 4-5 minutes). This is where the magic happens — don't rush this step!

### **Step 4: Build the Flavor Foundation (3 minutes)**
Add minced ginger and garlic to the caramelized onions. Sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in ground coriander, garam masala, and chili powder. Cook for another 30 seconds to bloom the spices.

### **Step 5: Bring It All Together (12 minutes)**
Return the seared chicken to the pot and toss to coat with the spice mixture. Add the cauliflower rice and gently fold everything together. Pour in the chicken broth and season with salt.

Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10-12 minutes until chicken is cooked through and cauliflower rice is tender but still has a slight bite.

### **Step 6: Fresh Herb Magic (2 minutes)**
Remove from heat and gently fold in fresh cilantro and mint. Let it rest for 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

### **Step 7: Garnish & Serve**
Remove whole spices if desired (or leave them for authenticity — just warn your guests!). Garnish with toasted almonds, raisins, and crispy onions if using.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use frozen cauliflower rice?**
A: Absolutely! Just make sure to thaw it completely and pat dry with paper towels. Frozen cauli-rice can be slightly more watery, so you might need to cook uncovered for the last few minutes to evaporate excess moisture.

**Q: My cauliflower rice turned out mushy. What went wrong?**
A: This usually happens from overcooking or too much moisture. Next time, pat the cauliflower rice completely dry and reduce cooking time by 2-3 minutes. The texture should be tender but still have a slight bite.

**Q: Can I make this in an Instant Pot?**
A: Yes! Use the sauté function for steps 2-4, then add everything else, seal, and pressure cook on high for 3 minutes with quick release. Perfect for bone-in chicken pieces too!

**Q: Is this recipe keto-friendly?**
A: Yes! With only 8g net carbs per serving, it fits perfectly into a keto meal plan. Just skip the raisins and you'll have even fewer carbs.

**Q: Can I double this recipe?**
A: Definitely! Use a larger pot and you might need to add 3-5 extra minutes to the cooking time. Perfect for meal prep or feeding a crowd.

**Q: What's the best way to rice fresh cauliflower?**
A: Use a food processor with the regular blade (not the grating attachment). Pulse in batches until pieces are rice-sized — about 6-8 pulses per batch. You can also use a box grater, but the food processor is much faster and more consistent.
