## 👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Prepare the Jackfruit Seeds (15 mins)**
1. **Boil the seeds:** Place jackfruit seeds in a pressure cooker with enough water to cover. Pressure cook for 2 whistles, or boil in a regular pot for 12-15 minutes until tender when pierced with a fork.

2. **Peel while warm:** Drain and let cool slightly. While still warm (easier to peel!), remove the outer white skin and inner brown membrane. The peeled seed should be smooth and ivory-colored.

3. **Optional roasting:** Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan and lightly roast the peeled seeds for 3-4 minutes until golden spots appear. This adds incredible depth of flavor!

### **Step 2: Make the Coconut Base (10 mins)**
4. **Coconut paste method:** If using fresh coconut, blend with ½ cup warm water until smooth. Strain to extract thick coconut milk. *Skip if using canned coconut milk.*

5. **Sauté aromatics:** Heat 2 tablespoons coconut oil in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add chopped onions and cook until golden (5-6 minutes). Add ginger, garlic, and green chilies. Sauté for 2 minutes until fragrant.

### **Step 3: Build the Curry (15 mins)**
6. **Add spices:** Lower heat and add turmeric, chili powder, and coriander powder. Stir for 30 seconds until aromatic (don't let them burn!).

7. **Create the gravy:** Pour in coconut milk gradually, stirring constantly. Add the roasted jackfruit seeds and bring to a gentle simmer.

8. **Simmer and season:** Let it bubble gently for 10-12 minutes until the seeds absorb the flavors and the curry reaches your desired consistency. Season with salt.

### **Step 4: The Perfect Tempering (3 mins)**
9. **Final tadka:** In a small pan, heat remaining oil. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add curry leaves and sliced shallots. Fry until shallots are golden.

10. **Finish and serve:** Pour this tempering over the curry. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot!
