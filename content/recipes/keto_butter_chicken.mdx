# Restaurant-Style Keto Butter Chicken (Only 6g Net Carbs!)

> **Rich, creamy, and impossibly satisfying** — this keto butter chicken delivers all the indulgent flavors of your favorite Indian restaurant without derailing your low-carb lifestyle!

The first time I tried to make butter chicken at home, I ended up with what can only be described as "tomato soup with confused chicken." Fast forward three years and countless recipe tests later, I've cracked the code on creating restaurant-quality butter chicken that fits perfectly into a ketogenic lifestyle.

What makes this recipe special? We're ditching the sugar-laden tomato base and flour thickeners that traditional recipes rely on, and instead building incredible depth of flavor through proper marination, high-heat searing, and a luxuriously creamy sauce that gets its body from heavy cream and a touch of cream cheese.

## 👨‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Marinate the Chicken (15 minutes)
1. **Mix the marinade:** In a large bowl, combine Greek yogurt, grated ginger, minced garlic, Kashmiri chili powder, and salt.
2. **Add chicken:** Toss chicken pieces until completely coated. Let marinate for at least 15 minutes (or up to 4 hours in the fridge for deeper flavor).

### Step 2: Sear the Chicken (8-10 minutes)
3. **Heat your pan:** Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat.
4. **Sear in batches:** Don't overcrowd! Sear chicken pieces for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown and slightly charred. Remove and set aside.

*Pro tip: The char is crucial for authentic flavor - don't rush this step!*

### Step 3: Build the Sauce Base (5-7 minutes)
5. **Sauté aromatics:** In the same pan, add diced onions and cook until softened and lightly golden (about 4-5 minutes).
6. **Add ginger and garlic:** Stir in fresh ginger and garlic, cooking for another minute until fragrant.
7. **Toast the spices:** Add garam masala, cumin, coriander, and turmeric. Stir constantly for 30 seconds until aromatic.

### Step 4: Create the Tomato Base (3-4 minutes)
8. **Add tomato puree:** Pour in the tomato puree and cook, stirring frequently, until it darkens slightly and reduces by about half.

### Step 5: Build the Creamy Sauce (5 minutes)
9. **Add cream cheese:** Whisk in the softened cream cheese until smooth and melted.
10. **Pour in cream:** Slowly add heavy cream, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
11. **Simmer:** Let the sauce come to a gentle simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes until slightly thickened.

### Step 6: Finish and Serve (3-5 minutes)
12. **Return chicken:** Add the seared chicken back to the sauce and simmer for 3-4 minutes until heated through.
13. **Final touches:** Stir in remaining butter and crushed kasuri methi leaves. Taste and adjust salt and spice level.
14. **Garnish and serve:** Top with fresh cilantro and a drizzle of cream if desired.

## 🎯 Pro Tips & Variations

### 🔥 For Extra Flavor:
- **Double marinate:** Marinate chicken overnight for incredibly tender, flavorful meat
- **Use chicken thighs:** They stay juicier than breasts and have more flavor
- **Char it up:** Use a grill pan or actual grill for authentic smoky flavor
- **Fresh spices matter:** Toast whole spices and grind them yourself when possible

### 🥥 Dairy-Free Keto Version:
- Swap heavy cream for full-fat coconut milk
- Use vegan butter or ghee
- Replace Greek yogurt with coconut yogurt for marinating

### 🌶️ Heat Level Adjustments:
- **Mild:** Skip the cayenne, use sweet paprika instead of Kashmiri chili
- **Medium:** Use recipe as written
- **Spicy:** Add fresh green chilies or extra cayenne to taste

### 🥄 Thickening Options:
- **Extra cream cheese:** Add another ounce for ultra-rich texture
- **Almond flour:** Whisk in 1-2 tablespoons if you prefer thicker sauce
- **Reduction:** Simply simmer longer to concentrate flavors

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use chicken breasts instead of thighs?**
A: Absolutely! Just be careful not to overcook them. Chicken breasts are done at 165°F internal temperature.

**Q: My sauce curdled - what went wrong?**
A: Usually from adding cold cream to hot sauce or cooking at too high heat. Always add cream slowly and keep heat at medium-low when simmering.

**Q: Is this really restaurant-style?**
A: Yes! The key is the proper char on the chicken and the cream-tomato balance. Many restaurants actually use similar techniques.

**Q: Can I make this in an Instant Pot?**
A: You can pressure cook the chicken, but I recommend making the sauce on the stovetop for better control and flavor development.

**Q: How do I make it less rich?**
A: Use half heavy cream and half unsweetened almond milk, or add a splash of chicken broth to thin it out.

**Q: What if I don't have kasuri methi?**
A: You can skip it, but it adds an authentic flavor. Dried oregano is a distant substitute, or order kasuri methi online - it keeps for months.
