## 👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Prep Your Mise en Place (5 minutes)**
Rinse the lentils in a fine-mesh strainer until the water runs clear. Dice your onion and carrot into small, uniform pieces — about ¼-inch cubes work perfectly. Mince the garlic and roughly chop the spinach if using large leaves. Trust me, having everything prepped makes the cooking process so much smoother!

### **Step 2: Build Your Flavor Base (5 minutes)**
Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the diced onion and carrot, cooking for 4-5 minutes until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant. The vegetables should sizzle gently — if they're browning too quickly, lower the heat.

### **Step 3: Add the Aromatics (1 minute)**
Stir in the minced garlic, cumin, smoked paprika, and coriander. Cook for just 30-60 seconds until incredibly fragrant. This blooming process releases the essential oils in the spices and creates a much deeper flavor foundation.

### **Step 4: Add Lentils & Simmer (20 minutes)**
Pour in the rinsed lentils and vegetable broth. Bring to a rolling boil, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook uncovered for 18-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are tender and starting to break down slightly. The soup should have a creamy consistency with some texture remaining.

### **Step 5: Wilt the Spinach (2 minutes)**
Add the chopped spinach in handfuls, stirring gently as each addition wilts down. Fresh spinach cooks incredibly quickly, so this only takes 1-2 minutes total. The spinach should be bright green and just wilted — not overcooked.

### **Step 6: Season & Finish (2 minutes)**
Remove from heat and stir in the fresh lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste, starting with 1 teaspoon of salt and adding more as needed. The lemon juice is crucial — it brightens all the earthy flavors and makes everything pop!

### **Step 7: Serve & Garnish**
Ladle into bowls and garnish with fresh chopped parsley, a drizzle of good olive oil, and a crack of black pepper. Serve immediately with crusty bread or pita for the ultimate comfort meal.

## 💡 Pro Tips & Expert Variations

### **🎯 Texture Preferences**
- **Love it chunky?** Keep as-is for a rustic, hearty texture
- **Want it creamy?** Use an immersion blender to partially blend the soup, leaving some texture

### **🌶️ Spice It Up**
- Add a pinch of red pepper flakes with the other spices
- Swirl in harissa paste for North African flair
- Include fresh ginger with the garlic for warming heat

### **🥥 Make It Richer**
- Stir in 2-3 tablespoons of coconut cream at the end
- Add a dollop of Greek yogurt when serving (if not vegan)

## 🥶 Storage & Meal Prep Magic

### **Refrigerator Storage**
This soup keeps beautifully in the fridge for up to 5 days in airtight containers. The flavors actually deepen and improve overnight — it's one of those magical dishes that tastes better as leftovers!

### **Freezer Storage**
Freeze in portion-sized containers for up to 3 months. Leave some headspace as the soup will expand when frozen. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.

### **Reheating Tips**
- **Stovetop:** Gently reheat over medium-low heat, adding a splash of broth if needed
- **Microwave:** Heat in 30-second intervals, stirring between
- **From frozen:** Thaw completely first for even heating

### **Meal Prep Strategy**
Make a double batch on Sunday and portion into individual containers. Add fresh lemon juice and herbs just before serving for the brightest flavor.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use other types of lentils?**
A: Absolutely! Green or brown lentils work beautifully but take 5-10 minutes longer to cook. Red lentils break down more, creating a naturally creamier soup, while green/brown lentils hold their shape better.

**Q: My soup is too thin — how do I thicken it?**
A: Simmer uncovered for an additional 5-10 minutes to reduce liquid, or blend a portion of the soup and stir it back in. You can also mash some lentils against the pot side with a spoon.

**Q: Can I use frozen spinach?**
A: Yes! Use about 1 cup of frozen spinach (thawed and drained). Add it in the last 2-3 minutes of cooking since it's already blanched.

**Q: How do I prevent the spinach from turning brown?**
A: Add spinach only in the final 2 minutes and don't overcook. The residual heat will wilt it perfectly while maintaining that gorgeous green color.

**Q: Is this soup suitable for diabetics?**
A: This soup is low glycemic and high in fiber, making it a good option for blood sugar management. However, always consult your healthcare provider about dietary changes.

**Q: Can I make this oil-free?**
A: Sure! Sauté the aromatics in a splash of vegetable broth instead of oil. The texture will be slightly different but still delicious.
