## 👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Prep Phase (5 minutes)
1. **Sift the ragi flour** into a large mixing bowl. This removes any lumps and makes rolling easier.
2. **Add salt** and mix well with your fingers.
3. **Make a well** in the center — this helps water distribute evenly.

### Dough Making (8 minutes)
4. **Add oil** (if using) to the flour mixture.
5. **Pour warm water gradually** — start with ½ cup, then add tablespoon by tablespoon.
6. **Mix with a spoon first**, then use your hands when it's cool enough.
7. **Knead for 3-4 minutes** until you get a smooth, pliable dough. The dough should be slightly softer than chapati dough but not sticky.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Ragi dough behaves differently than wheat dough — it's more delicate and doesn't need aggressive kneading.

### Rolling & Cooking (15 minutes)
8. **Rest the dough** for 5 minutes covered with a damp cloth.
9. **Divide into 8 equal portions** and shape into smooth balls.
10. **Dust your work surface** generously with dry ragi flour.
11. **Roll each ball** into a 6-inch circle. Be gentle — ragi rotis are more fragile than wheat ones.
12. **Heat your tawa or skillet** on medium-high heat.
13. **Cook the first side** for 1-2 minutes until small bubbles form.
14. **Flip and cook** the other side for 1 minute until light brown spots appear.
15. **Optional puffing:** Use tongs to hold the roti directly over flame for 5-10 seconds to puff.

## 🎯 Master Chef Tips for Perfect Ragi Rotis

### The Water Temperature Trick
Use **warm (not hot) water** — it helps bind the ragi flour better than cold water and creates softer rotis.

### The Gentle Rolling Method
Ragi dough is more delicate than wheat dough. **Roll gently in one direction, then rotate** rather than aggressive back-and-forth rolling.

### The Two-Temperature Cooking Method
Start on **medium-high heat** for the first side, then **reduce to medium** for the second side. This prevents burning while ensuring proper cooking.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ **Over-kneading** — leads to tough rotis
- ❌ **Too much water** — makes dough sticky and hard to roll
- ❌ **High heat throughout** — burns exterior before interior cooks
- ❌ **Rolling too thin** — causes tearing and uneven cooking

## 📈 The Science Behind Low-GI Eating

Understanding why ragi roti works so well for blood sugar management can help you make informed dietary choices. The **glycemic index (GI)** measures how quickly foods raise blood glucose levels. Foods with a GI below 55 are considered low-GI.

Ragi's low GI comes from its **complex carbohydrate structure** and **high fiber content**. Unlike simple carbs that spike blood sugar quickly, ragi releases glucose slowly and steadily, providing sustained energy without the crashes.

For diabetics, this means:
- Better post-meal blood sugar control
- Reduced insulin requirements
- Lower risk of diabetic complications
- Improved energy levels throughout the day
