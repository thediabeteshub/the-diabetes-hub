## 👨‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Preparing the Dough
1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and carom seeds (if using). Mix well.

2. **Add Oil:** Pour in the oil and rub it into the flour using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.

3. **Form Dough:** Gradually add warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until a stiff dough forms. You want it firm but pliable.

4. **Rest the Dough:** Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 30 minutes. This makes rolling easier!

### Making the Filling
5. **Prep Your Spices:** Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.

6. **Sauté Aromatics:** Add chopped onions and cook until golden (about 3-4 minutes). Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, cook for another minute.

7. **Add Spices:** Stir in all the spice powders (coriander, garam masala, turmeric, chili powder, amchur) and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.

8. **Mix in Potatoes:** Add the mashed potatoes and peas. Mix everything thoroughly and cook for 3-4 minutes.

9. **Final Seasoning:** Add salt and fresh coriander. Mix well and let the filling cool completely before assembling.

### Shaping the Samosas
10. **Divide Dough:** Make 8 equal portions and roll each into a ball.

11. **Roll and Cut:** Roll each ball into an oval, then cut in half to get 2 semi-circles.

12. **Form Cone:** Take one semi-circle, wet the edges with water, and form a cone shape by overlapping the straight edges.

13. **Fill and Seal:** Add 1-2 tablespoons of filling, then wet the open edges and press firmly to seal into a triangle.

14. **Repeat:** Continue until all samosas are assembled.

### Air-Frying Magic
15. **Preheat Air Fryer:** Set to 375°F (190°C) for 3 minutes.

16. **Brush with Oil:** Lightly brush each samosa with oil or melted ghee for that golden color.

17. **Air Fry in Batches:** Place 6-8 samosas in the basket (don't overcrowd). Cook for 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway through.

18. **Check for Doneness:** They should be golden brown and crispy. If needed, cook for 2-3 more minutes.

19. **Serve Hot:** Enjoy immediately with mint chutney and tamarind sauce!

## 🎯 Pro Tips & Variations

### Expert Secrets
- **Dough Consistency:** The dough should be stiffer than roti dough but not crumbly. This ensures crispy samosas that don't break.
- **Cooling is Key:** Always let the filling cool completely. Hot filling makes the dough soggy and harder to seal.
- **Sealing Hack:** Use a fork to press the edges for extra security and a decorative look.
- **Oil Brushing:** Don't skip this step! It's what gives you that beautiful golden color in the air fryer.

### Delicious Variations
- **🌱 Protein Boost:** Add cooked lentils (dal) or paneer cubes to the filling
- **🥕 Veggie Mix:** Include finely chopped carrots, cabbage, or cauliflower
- **🌰 Festive Touch:** Add a few chopped cashews or raisins for sweetness
- **🌶️ Spice Level:** Adjust green chilies and red chili powder to your preference
- **🌾 Healthier Option:** Use whole wheat flour or add some besan (chickpea flour)

### Make-Ahead Magic
- **Freeze Before Cooking:** Assemble samosas and freeze on a tray. Once frozen, store in bags for up to 3 months.
- **Cook from Frozen:** Add 3-4 extra minutes to air-frying time.
- **Prep Filling:** Make filling 2 days ahead and refrigerate.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use my regular oven instead of an air fryer?**
A: Absolutely! Bake at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.

**Q: Why are my samosas not crispy?**
A: Three common reasons: dough too soft, not enough oil brushing, or overcrowding the air fryer basket. Give them space to crisp up!

**Q: Can I make these completely oil-free?**
A: While you can skip the oil in the dough and filling, I recommend at least brushing them lightly for better texture and color.

**Q: How do I prevent the samosas from opening while cooking?**
A: Make sure edges are properly wetted and pressed firmly. Using a fork to seal adds extra security.

**Q: Can I use sweet potato instead of regular potatoes?**
A: Yes! Sweet potatoes work wonderfully and add natural sweetness. You might want to reduce the amchur (dry mango powder) slightly.

**Q: How long can I store cooked samosas?**
A: In the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Reheat in the air fryer at 350°F for 3-4 minutes to restore crispiness.

## 🎉 Cultural Connection

Samosas have a rich history dating back to the 10th century, originally brought to India by traders from Central Asia. What started as a way to preserve meat for long journeys evolved into the beloved vegetarian snack we know today. Each region of India has its own twist - from the smaller cocktail samosas of Mumbai to the larger, spicier versions of North India.

By air-frying these traditional treats, we're not changing the soul of the dish, just making it more accessible to modern, health-conscious families. It's a beautiful example of how we can honor tradition while adapting to contemporary needs.
