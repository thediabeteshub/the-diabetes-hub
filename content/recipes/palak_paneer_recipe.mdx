## 👨‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Blanch the Spinach (5 minutes)**
1. **Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.** Add the washed spinach leaves.
2. **Blanch for exactly 2 minutes** until bright green and wilted.
3. **Immediately transfer to an ice bath** to stop cooking and preserve that gorgeous green color.
4. **Drain thoroughly** and roughly chop. *This step is crucial for restaurant-quality color!*

### **Step 2: Prepare the Base (5 minutes)**
1. **Heat oil in a non-stick pan** over medium heat.
2. **Add cumin seeds** and let them splutter for 30 seconds.
3. **Add chopped onions** and sauté until translucent (about 3-4 minutes).
4. **Add ginger, garlic, and green chili** — cook until fragrant (1 minute).
5. **Optional: Add chopped tomato** and cook until soft and mushy.

### **Step 3: Create the Silky Puree (3 minutes)**
1. **Let the onion mixture cool slightly.**
2. **Transfer to a blender along with the blanched spinach** and 1/4 cup water.
3. **Blend until completely smooth** — this is your secret to restaurant-style texture!

### **Step 4: Bring It All Together (7 minutes)**
1. **Pour the spinach puree back into the same pan.**
2. **Add ground coriander, garam masala, and salt.**
3. **Simmer on low heat for 3-4 minutes** until slightly thickened.
4. **Gently fold in the low-fat paneer cubes** — don't stir too vigorously!
5. **Optional: Swirl in Greek yogurt** for extra richness.
6. **Taste and adjust seasoning** — add a pinch of sugar if it tastes too tart.

### **Step 5: Serve & Enjoy!**
**Garnish with a light drizzle of cream (if desired)** and serve hot with brown rice, whole wheat roti, or cauliflower rice for a low-carb option.

**♨️ Reheating Like a Pro:**

- **Fresh herbs** bring it back to life — try mint or cilantro

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use regular full-fat paneer instead?**
A: Absolutely! Just know that the calories will increase to about 285 per serving. The cooking method stays exactly the same.

**Q: My spinach puree tastes bitter — what went wrong?**
A: This usually happens when spinach is overcooked. Next time, blanch for exactly 2 minutes and use that ice bath! A tiny pinch of sugar can help balance existing bitterness.

**Q: Is frozen spinach just as good?**
A: While fresh is ideal for color and texture, frozen works great for busy weeknights. Use 300g frozen spinach (thawed and well-drained) and skip the blanching step.

**Q: How can I make this even lower in calories?**
A: Use cooking spray instead of oil for sautéing, and try adding steamed cauliflower florets to bulk up the dish without many calories.

**Q: Can I make this ahead for dinner parties?**
A: Yes! Make the spinach base up to 2 days ahead. Add paneer and final seasonings when ready to serve — your guests will think you're a culinary wizard!

**Q: What if I can't find low-fat paneer?**
A: Make your own! Heat 4 cups low-fat milk, add 2 tbsp lemon juice, strain through cheesecloth. Or substitute with extra-firm tofu for a vegan option.
