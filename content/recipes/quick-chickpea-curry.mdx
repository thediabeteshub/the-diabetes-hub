### Ingredients

- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, grated
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1/2 tsp red chili powder (or to taste)
- 1 can (400g) chopped tomatoes
- 1 can (400g) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 can (400ml) light coconut milk
- 200g fresh spinach
- Salt to taste
- Fresh cilantro, for garnish

### Instructions

1.  Heat the coconut oil in a large pan or pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
2.  Add the minced garlic and grated ginger. Saut√© for another minute until fragrant.
3.  Stir in the turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili powder. Cook for 30 seconds until the spices are aromatic.
4.  Pour in the chopped tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.
5.  Add the drained chickpeas and light coconut milk. Stir everything together, bring to a simmer, and then reduce the heat to low. Let it cook for 10 minutes.
6.  Stir in the fresh spinach. It will look like a lot, but it will wilt down into the curry in just a couple of minutes.
7.  Season with salt to your liking.
8.  Serve hot, garnished with fresh cilantro, alongside brown rice or quinoa.
