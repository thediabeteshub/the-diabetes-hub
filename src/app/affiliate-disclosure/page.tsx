        <h2>1. Transparency Is Our Priority</h2>
        <p>
        Our mission at The Diabetes Hub is to provide you with the most helpful, reliable, and culturally relevant information for managing diabetes with a South Asian lifestyle. To keep our content free and our website running, we participate in affiliate marketing programs.
        </p>
        <p>
        This means that your trust is our most important asset. We want to be completely transparent about how we earn money.
        </p>

        <h2>2. What Is an Affiliate Link?</h2>
        <p>
        Throughout our website, especially in articles with product recommendations (like kitchen tools, specific food ingredients, or books), you may find links that are &quotaffiliate links.&quot
        </p>
        <p>
        This simply means that if you click on one of these links and end up making a purchase from that retailer, we will receive a small commission from the sale. <strong>This comes at absolutely no extra cost to you.</strong> The price you pay is the same whether you use our link or go directly to the vendor&apos;s website.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Our Promise and Guiding Principles</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>We Only Recommend What We Trust:</strong> We only link to products and services that we have personally used, thoroughly researched, or genuinely believe will add value to your health journey. Our recommendations are based on our own expert opinion and experience.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Our Content Is Not Influenced by Commissions:</strong> Our primary goal is to provide you with the best possible advice. The content we create is independent and objective. We do not accept payment for positive reviews, and our opinions are our own.
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Why We Do This</h2>
        <p>
        Running a high-quality website involves costsâ€”from web hosting and design to content creation and research. The small commissions we receive from affiliate links help us cover these costs, allowing us to continue providing you with free, valuable, and well-researched content.
        </p>
        <p>
        By using our affiliate links, you are helping to support The Diabetes Hub, and we are genuinely grateful for your support.
        </p>
